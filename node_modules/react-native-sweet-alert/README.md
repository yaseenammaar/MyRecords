## Getting started

`$ npm install react-native-sweet-alert --save`

### Mostly automatic installation

`$ react-native link react-native-sweet-alert`

### Manual installation

# On Android:

__In the AndroidManifest.xml file__

Below this line:

`
xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
`

add this:

`
xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
`

And in the `<application>` tag, add this property:

`
tools:replace="android:icon"
`

so it will look like:

```
<application
  android:name=".MainApplication"
  android:allowBackup="true"
  android:label="@string/app_name"
  android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
  tools:replace="android:icon"
  android:theme="@style/AppTheme">
```

# On iOS:

Since the vendor library is written in Swift, apart from doing usual `react-native link react-native-sweet-alert`, you will also have to create a Bridging Header for Swift file, which is also pretty easy:

- ou have to create at least a `.swift` file in your project. It can be an empty Swift file, but it must exist. After that, XCode will ask you to "Create bridging header?" which enables Swift Bridging Header in Build Settings below.

- Open the project with XCode (don't forget to open XCode, since using other editors won't be enough), create a new `.h` file. I recommend to create something like `<Your-App-Name>-Bridging-Header.h` , for example, if your app is named `CuteApp`, then it should be `CuteApp-Bridging-Header.h`

- Paste in following code into that newly created `.h` file:

````
#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>
#import <React/RCTEventEmitter.h>
#import <React/RCTViewManager.h>
#import <React/RCTConvert.h>
#import <React/RCTUtils.h>
````

Or you can just see `Example-Bridging-Header.h` and copy and paste in.

- In XCode, make sure you chose your app target. Go to `Build Settings`:

- Now to the important part: In `Objective-C Bridging Header`, double-click on it and type in your created `.h` file earlier. In the above example it is `CuteApp-Bridging-Header.h`.

- Make sure the path is relative. For example, if `CuteApp-Bridging-Header.h` is in `ios` folder, you only have to type `CuteApp-Bridging-Header.h` , but if it's in a sub-folder, you have to add the path too, e.g: `some-path/CuteApp-Bridging-Header.h`.

- In `Swift Language Version`, choose `4.2`. Yeah I had to convert the syntax of original library from Swift 2 to Swift 4.


__And then you can use the library like so:__

```
import SweetAlert from 'react-native-sweet-alert';
```

```
SweetAlert.showAlertWithOptions({
  title: '',
  subTitle: '',
  confirmButtonTitle: 'OK',
  confirmButtonColor: '#000',
  otherButtonTitle: 'Cancel',
  otherButtonColor: '#dedede',
  style: 'success',
  cancellable: true
},
  callback => console.log('callback'));
```

- The first parameter is dialog option with above available properties. Please note that `confirmButtonColor` and `otherButtonColor` is only available on iOS.

- The second parameter is callback, which returns a boolean value. Use it as you wish.

### With the dialog in progress mode, we also have following methods available (Android Only):

`resetCount()` Reset the counter of the progress.

`isSpinning(): Promise` Get spinning status of the progress bar.

`spin():` Start spinning.

`setBarColor(type: string)` Changes the progress bar color. Argument must be a hex color string like `#ff0000`
